# Heat-map analytics
The project is about developing an analytics pipeline to generate geo-located
heat maps from time-series IoT data.

## Problem Statement
The time series contains temporal
information about IoT data events observed
over time. The geolocation information of
the source device is outside of this stream.

## Project Proposal
The aim is to develop an analytical pipeline
to match time series with geo-location
information and perform aggregation overt
time windows. The final result is the
development of a geo-heat map visualization
tool.
